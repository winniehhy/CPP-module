Assignement name: vect2
Expected files: vect2.cpp, vect2.hpp
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a class vect2 representing a mathematical vector of dimension 2 containing ints.

It must support addition, substraction and multiplication by a scalar (such as the expression (vect2(2,2) * 2 == vect2(4,4)) is true).

the operator [] can be used to access the component of your vector (with 0 and 1), no bound checking is required.

Your function must be printable with the << operator such as:
        std::cout << y << std::endl;
produce the same output as:
        s << "{" << v[0] << ", " << v[1] << "}" << std::endl;

You will find a main in this directory that must work with your class.
