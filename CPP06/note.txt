1️⃣ What is casting? (very simple)

👉 Casting = putting a label on something

The thing does NOT change.
Only the label you use to talk about it changes.

🧸 A teddy bear

You can call it:

“toy”

“bear”

“brown thing”

Same toy.
Different labels.

➡️ That’s casting.

------------------------------
Objects and Labels in C++

In C++:

Object = the real thing in memory

Type = the label


-------------------------------
static_cast — “Trust me 😎”
🧠 How it works (kid version)

👩‍🏫 Compiler asks:

“Are you allowed to use this label?”

If yes → OK
If no → Error

❌ It does NOT check the real thing

🧸 Example
Base* b = new Derived();
Derived* d = static_cast<Derived*>(b);


Compiler thinks:

“Derived is a kind of Base, so OK 👍”

✅ Works

😱 Dangerous example
Base* b = new Base();
Derived* d = static_cast<Derived*>(b); // 😬


Compiler says:

“You say it’s a Derived? Fine.”

But in reality:

It’s NOT a Derived

Program may crash



------------------
How it works (kid version)

The program checks the toy itself.

“Are you REALLY a teddy bear?”

If yes → OK

If no → Say “nope” safely

🧸 Example
Base* b = new Base();
Derived* d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b);


Program checks:

“Is this actually a Derived?”

❌ No → d == nullptr

No crash. Safe. 😊
------------------------------------

Use static_cast when:

✔ You are 100% sure
✔ Simple number conversions
✔ Upcasting (Derived → Base)

Use dynamic_cast when:

✔ You are not sure
✔ Downcasting (Base → Derived)
